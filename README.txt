-----------------------------------------

In Task-2, we have implemented a model based on [1]. For the implementation we have used the pytorch geometric temporal library.
The model is an extension to the TGCN model [2], but also uses attention.

It consists of three blocks, each of 2 layers: 'GCNConv' and a 'Linear' layer. As we have used number of hidden channels = 16, so the number of out_channels for each GCNConv layer is 16. 

At the end, another 'Linear' layer is used where number of input features = 16, and the number of output features = f.

The model is trained batchwise, using mini-batch size of 128, and Adam optimizer.
