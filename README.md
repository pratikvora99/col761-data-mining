# COL761 Data Mining

As part of the course COL761-Data Mining taken at IIT Delhi, I got the chance to work on these projects. The projects range from traditional data science problems like pattern mining to modern problems concerning GNNs. <br>

The projects are:
<ul>
  <li>Frequent Pattern Mining</li>
  <li>Subgraph Isomorphism</li>
  <li>Traffic Prediction using GNN</li>
</ul>
